### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Onaje but my friends call me Naj. I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in education. I've learned and built with HTML, CSS, Styled Components, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Express, and a few more. Always excited to learn more and put gained knowledge into practical use.
- I’m currently working on creating a DOPE portfolio!
- I’m currently learning more about design/using Tailwind CSS
- I’m looking to collaborate on an app for my aunt's organic farm
- I’m looking for help with getting better at UI
- Ask me about the pivot from education to tech 😼
- How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ooladuwa)
- Pronouns: he/him
- Fun fact: I was the 6th grade teacher you loved to love!
